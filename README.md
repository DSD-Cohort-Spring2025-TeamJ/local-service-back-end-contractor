# Service Booking Application
Welcome to the Service Booking Backend Application, a web-based platform designed to simplify the process of booking home services such as plumbing, water leakage repairs, and sewer maintenance etc. This application leverages AI to match user-reported issues with the most suitable service recognition, streamlining the booking process for end users, technicians, and administrators.

## Features
  * **User-Friendly Interface:** End users can easily describe their issues (e.g., plumbing, water leakage, sewer problems) via the web app.
  * **AI-Powered Service Matching:** The app intelligently analyzes user input to recommend the most appropriate service.
  * **Booking System:** Users can select their preferred date and time for the service after the issue is identified.
  * **Admin Dashboard:** Admins can review, accept, decline, or leave bookings as pending.
  * **Automated Notifications**:  
    * Technicians receive email notifications with booking details once the admin approves.
    * If required parts are out of stock, technicians are notified in advance.
  * **Scalable Backend:** Handles user requests, admin approvals, and email workflows efficiently.  

## How It Works
  1. **User Submission:** The end user visits the web app and submits a description of their issue (e.g., "leaking pipe in the kitchen").
  2. **AI Analysis:** The AI processes the description and suggests the best service match (e.g., plumbing).
  3. **Booking:** The user is redirected to a page to choose a convenient date and time for the service.
  4. **Admin Review:** The admin reviews the booking and can accept, decline, or leave it pending.
  5. **Technician Assignment:** Upon approval, the system emails the assigned technician with details.
  6. **Stock Check:** If parts are unavailable, an additional email notifies the technician before their visit.
